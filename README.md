# React to Python: A Task Management Adventure
 React to Python: A Task Management Adventure: Built with Python & React" is a web-based task management application designed to efficiently handle and manage tasks. Leveraging the robust back-end capabilities of Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy and the dynamic front-end framework of React.js, the application provides user-friendly interfaces for task creation, updates, retrieval, and deletion (CRUD operations). A user can register, login and interact with the task system, adding and organizing tasks based on priority and due date. The application incorporates JWT for user authentication, ensuring secure user sessions. Despite being in the early stages of development, this project shows promising prospects in the realm of task management applications.
